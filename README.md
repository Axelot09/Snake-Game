# Snake-Game

The Snake game is a timeless classic where players guide a constantly growing snake to consume food items scattered across the screen. As the snake eats, it grows longer, increasing the challenge of maneuvering within the confined game area. The objective is to avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own body, requiring strategic navigation and quick reflexes. This simple yet addictive game offers endless entertainment as players strive to achieve higher scores by keeping the snake alive and continuously growing.
